# About Me
I am a aerospace engineering student and technology enthusiast. In my free time you can generally find me playing VR games and testing new content in social platforms
like NeosVR, ChilloutVR, and VRChat. I also occasionally design 3D character models. For the last year I have been working in the biorenewables field designing a
plastics degredation reactor and feed system for research applications. Computer science has always facinated me and I enjoy writing programs to make my life easier.
